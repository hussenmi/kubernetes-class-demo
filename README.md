# kubernetes-class-demo
This repository contains scripts for demonstrating different features of Kubernetes such as how we can use it for scaling applications, updating with no downtime, rolling back updates, etc.

This [video](https://screenapp.io/app/#/shared/3d44a228-dc83-4f29-b85b-d4383fcaa921) demonstrates some of the features of Kubernetes.

To make shell files executable, run the command chmod +x [NAME OF FILE]. 

For example, `chmod +x setup_kubernetes.sh`

Once you make the file executable, you can run it by using `./` as a prefix to file.

For example, `./setup_kubernetes.sh`

If you are on Windows and you already have Docker installed, you probably already installed Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 (WSL2) when you installed Docker. This is how a Linux container can run on Windows. You can use that terminal to run these commands. You can also use the Git Bash terminal if you have it on your system.
